 Queues a request for execution as a data request. The task will be started when it reaches its position in the queue. It

 @param request The URL request to queue and execute.
 @param completionHandler Block to be executed whenever an attempt is completed. This will be called whether the request
 is successful or not. If the request has been requeued, the reattempting flag will be set to YES.
 @param attempts The maximum number of attempts to make before giving up. A value of 0 or negative will continue to attempt
 until successful response is complete.
 @return A pointer to the actual task in the queue.
 @warning Although the task is returned, you should avoid controlling it directly. It is provided for monitoring purposes
 rather than direct control. It will be started when its place in the queue is reached, and doing so earlier may result
 in problems for this request, or others, particularly in respect to the iOS concurrent connection limits.
